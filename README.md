# HW-2

HW_2 represents Question 1. It represents the function to determine whether or not random uniformly distributed points fall into a circle of radius 1 within a (-1,1) x (-1,1) square. When the number of points that fall in the circle is divided by the total number of points, it creates a fraction, that when multiplied by 4, is approximately pi.

Points is also part of Question 1. It plots the estimated number of pi and the error (which is the absolute value of the estimated number minus the actual value of pi) in relation to the total number of points from the function 2^k, where k = 10, 11, ..., 20.
